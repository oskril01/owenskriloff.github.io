    <p>I study how to build models to solve problems by aligning their structure with the structure of the problem itself, and the formalization of such ideas. My interests lie at the intersection of category theory, optimization, scientific computing, and mathematical physics.</p>
    <p>I studied chemical engineering, mathematics, and chemical physics as an undergraduate, and I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in mathematics at Tufts University. This site collects my research, projects, and artwork.</p>
    <p>Outside of academics, I’m an avid reader and artist. I love to draw, paint, and spend time traveling and in museums. I also enjoy skiing, running, hiking, and doing flips.</p>
